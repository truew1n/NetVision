# Multi-Client TCP/IP Communication Application

## Project Overview
This repository contains two WPF applications developed in C# that communicate using the TCP/IP protocol. The **Sender Application** features a data grid for managing and sending records, along with a countdown timer. The **Receiver Application** displays received data, confirms receipt, and mirrors the timer's status, enabling bidirectional data transfer and real-time connection status updates.
